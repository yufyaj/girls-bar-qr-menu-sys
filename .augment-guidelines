# .cursorrules ─ QRオーダー & 会計連携システム

## 01 – Authoritative Sources
- **Always cite the _latest_ Supabase docs registered in Cursor as “Supabase” and the newest official Next-js docs stored in Cursor.**  
- If an API isn’t covered, file a “doc-update” task instead of guessing.

## 02 – Supabase Access
- **All Supabase calls must flow through backend Route Handlers or Server Actions.** Front-end direct calls are forbidden; flag a PR if detected.

## 03 – Learning from Feedback
- Any reviewer comment that begins with `RULE:` becomes a new rule appended to this file automatically.

## 04 – Component Factorisation
- Extract shared UI/logic into `/components/ui/**` or `/features/**` per Atomic + Feature-Slice.

## 05 – Design Patterns
- Follow the Presentation → State → Domain → Data → Infrastructure layering.  
- Warn if a new PR skips layers.

## 06 – Document & Progress Sync
- Changes that alter behaviour/public contracts **must update 要件定義書 & 詳細設計書** in the same PR.  
- New features not in the docs require prior reviewer approval.  
- Update the **進捗管理表** check-list whenever a task completes.

## 07 – Test-First
- Every production file added/changed must ship with matching tests; block PRs that lower coverage.

## 08 – Windows CLI Compatibility  ← NEW
- **All code snippets and setup commands must run on Windows (CMD or PowerShell).**  
  - Use `copy` or `xcopy` instead of `cp` :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
  - Use `Remove-Item` instead of `rm` :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
  - Show `npm install` and `node app.js` exactly as they appear in Windows docs :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
  - Installation/setup links should reference official Windows guides (Git for Windows, Node installer, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- If a cross-platform shell command _must_ be included, also supply the Windows variant or a PowerShell one-liner.

## 09 – Lint & Style
- Enforce ESLint, Prettier; CI fails on violations.

## 10 – Communication
- If unclear or conflicting, ask for clarification instead of assuming.

## 11 - Chat
- Always output in japanese.
